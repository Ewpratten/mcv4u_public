This is a small note on non-square matrices.

 - Each column of the matrix is a "hat"
 - They are used to transform between dimensions
   - An x-by-y matrix transforms from the x-dimension to the y-dimension

## An example

Take a look at the following matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    2 & 0\\
    -1 & 1\\
    -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is a 3-by-2 matrix, so it is used to transform from the 3rd dimension to the 2nd dimension
