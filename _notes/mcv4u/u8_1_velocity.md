| Velocity | Rate of change of position per unit of time |
| Average velocity | $\frac{\Delta displacement}{\Delta time} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ |
| Instantaneous velocity | $\frac{d}{dt} \underbrace{s}_{\text{tangent}}$ **or** $v(t) = s^\prime(t)$ |

Some notes on velocity:

 - Velocity is a vector, so it has both a magnitude and direction.
 - Speed is a scalar, so it has only a magnitude
 - $speed = \vert velocity\vert$
 - $v(t) > 0$: motion is upward or to the right (in this course)
 - $v(t) <> 0$: motion is downward or to the left (in this course)
