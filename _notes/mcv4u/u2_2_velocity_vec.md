 - The velocity of an object is stated relative to a frame of reference. 
 - The frame of reference used influences the velocity.

## Air Speed & Water Speed

 - The speed of an object relative to the frame of reference of the air current or water current.
 - The speed of an object such as a plane or boat as measured (observed) by a person being carried by the current.

## Ground Speed

 - The speed of an object moving relative to the frame of reference of the ground.
 - The speed of an object such as a plane or boat as measured (observed) by a person on the ground
 - This includes the effect of the wind or current.
 - Generally the resultant speed
