Critical values are x-values where $f^\prime(x) = 0$ **or** $f^\prime(x)$ is undefined. This implies that all local max/mins occur at a critical value. Keep in mind however:

 - Not all critical values yield a max/min (do the 1st derivative test)
 - Critical values where $f’(x)$ is undefined are the locations of cusps, corners, vertical tangents and discontinuities

## 1st Derivative Test

If $x = c$ is a critical value, then there is a:

 - Local maximum if $f’(x)$ changes from a positive to a negative at $c$
 - Local minimum if $f’(x)$ changes from a negative to a positive at $c$
