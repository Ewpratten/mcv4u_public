## The Constant Multiple Rule

If $f(x) = cg(x)$ for any constant $c$, then $f^\prime(x) = cg^\prime(x)$

## The Sum Rule & Difference Rule

If functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are differentiable, and $f(x) = p(x) \pm q(x)$, then $f^\prime(x) = p^\prime(x) \pm g^\prime(x)$

*The derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of their derivatives*

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(g(x) + h(x)) = \frac{dg}{dx} + \frac{dh}{dx}
$$

## Note: the derivative of $sin$

The derivative of a sine function is the cosine function
