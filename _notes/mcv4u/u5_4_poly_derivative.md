We have the ability to determine the slope of a curve (the derivative) at any given point.

$$
\lim\limits_{h \rarr 0} \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

 - Represents the slope of the tangent to the curve $f(x)$ where $x = a$
 - Represents the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ where $x = a$

For a specific value of $x$ ($x=a$):

$$
m_{tan} = \lim\limits_{h \rarr 0} \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

For all values of $x$ (derivative functions):

$$
 f^\prime (x) = \lim\limits_{h \rarr 0} \frac{f(x +h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
