## Scalars vs Vectors

| Scalar    | Vector    |
| --------- | --------- |
| Magnitude | Magnitude |
|           | Direction |

 - Scalars
   - Area
   - Age
   - Speed
   - Mass
   - Temperature
 - Vectors
   - Velocity
   - Weight
   - Force
   - Displacement
   - Acceleration

## Notation

A vector with the tail $A$ and head $B$ is denoted as $\vec{AB}$. These vectors can also be noted with a single letter ($\vec{u}$,$\vec{v}$,$\vec{w}$, ... ).

The magnitude of a vector is denoted using vertical bars: $\vert\vec{AB}\vert$

## Equality

Two vectors are equal if they are parallel to each other, have the same direction, *and* the magnitudes are equal.  Equal vectors are not required to be located at the same position in space.

## Opposite Vectors

Two vectors are opposite if they have the same magnitude but point in opposite directions

 - $\vec{FE}$ and $\vec{EF}$ are opposites
 - $\vec{FE} = -\vec{EF}$
 - $\vert\vec{FE}\vert = \vert\vec{EF}\vert$
