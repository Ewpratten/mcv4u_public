## $\vec{OP}$ in $R^2$
 - Is considered a **unique position vector** where its tail is at $O(0,0)$ and its head at $P(a,b)$
 - It is represented in component form $(a, b)$ where **a** is the x-component and **b** is the y-component

## $\vec{OP}$ in $R^3$

 - Is considered a **unique position vector** where its tail is at $O(0,0,0)$ and its head at $P(a,b,c)$
 - It is represented in component form $(a,b,c)$ where **a** is the x-component, **b** is the y-component, and **c** is the z-component

## Points on planes

 - Any point on the **XY** plane will appear as $(x,y,0)$
 - Any point on the **YZ** plane will appear as $(0,y,z)$
 - Any point on the **XZ** plane will appear as $(x,0,z)$
