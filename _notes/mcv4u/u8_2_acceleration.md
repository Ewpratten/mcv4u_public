| Acceleration | Rate of change of velocity per unit of time.<br> It is the second derivative of position. |
| Average acceleration | $\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ |
| Instantaneous acceleration | $a = \frac{d}{dt}v = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ **or** $a(t) = v^\prime(t) = a^{\prime\prime}(t)$ |

Note:

 - $a(t) > 0$: object is accelerating upward or to the right (in this course)
 - $a(t) < 0$: object is accelerating downward or to the left (in this course)
 - If velocity and acceleration are acting in the same direction the object is speeding up.
 - If the velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions, the object is slowing down
