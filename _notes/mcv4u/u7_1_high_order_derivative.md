 - The derivative of a derivative is called the second derivative and can be represented by:
   - Newton: $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$
   - Leibniz: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$
 - The derivative of the second derivative is called the third derivative and can be represented by:
   - Newton: $f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)$
   - Leibniz: $\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}$
