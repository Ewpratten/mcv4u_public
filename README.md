## Repo Info

This repository is a stripped-down duplicate of my private *Highschool Notes Monorepo*. No effort is made to ensure the code, configs, and content makes any sense to anyone except me (the only author). If you are interested in learning about the latest revision of my note-taking setup, contact me.

As of now, **MCV4U** is the only class I plan to publish my notes from.
